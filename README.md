# Portfolio

A portfolio web page with a log in form and a data base made with bootstrap and PHP. The web page has so much css because of the bootstrap framework files. This is a unfinished portfolio with a responsive design, a slider, a log in form and the option to write out all of the users that loged in.

To run this web page you have to use a apache web server, mysql and php. I used xampp that includes all what is needed to run this web page.
